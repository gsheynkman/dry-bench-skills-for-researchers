# Data Access Journey

Human data in the cloud requires that a research propose the exact reason why they require access to this data and the proposed project.

Typically, it is reviewed by a data access committee and approved accordingly.

Data access usually lasts for about 1 year, at the end of which a report must be made.

Access usually involves a Signing Official from your organization.   This is the case for applying for access to data from the Database of Phenotypes and Genotypes.

When approved - you sign in and you are presented with a login screen that gives you the ability to access the data.
